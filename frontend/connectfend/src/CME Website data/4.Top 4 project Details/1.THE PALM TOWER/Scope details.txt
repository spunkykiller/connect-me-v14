Project Name: THE PALM TOWER
Business Challenge:

Multiple BTU meter brands were operating on independent software platforms.

Each platform generated meter data in different formats, requiring extensive manual consolidation.

Manual Excel-based data processing led to data inconsistencies, missing readings, and billing inaccuracies.

Lack of real-time visibility and absence of offline/fault alerts increased operational risk.

Overall meter data management was inefficient, labor-intensive, and not scalable.

Implemented  centralized IBM Meter Data Management platform integrating five different BTU meter brands.

Standardized meter data collection, processing, and reporting across all brands.

Enabled real-time meter monitoring, including fault and offline status visibility.

Delivered customized billing and consumption reports aligned with Nakheel’s reporting standards.

Automated daily meter data acquisition, eliminating manual intervention.

Business Impact:

Improved billing accuracy and data reliability.

Eliminated manual data handling and reduced operational workload.

Enhanced operational transparency through real-time monitoring.

Delivered a scalable and future-ready solution, resulting in high customer satisfaction from the Nakheel team.
